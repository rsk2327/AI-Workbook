They also began a series of machine \\nlearning meetings that eventually turned into NIPS, the leading \\nconference on machine learning. This group was representative \\nof the early machine learning community, breaking away from a \\ncomputer science field still mostly interested in expert systems. \\nThese theoreticians were confronted with real world problems \\nwhere machines had to replace humans in recognizing noisy \\nwritten digits: mainly check amounts and zip codes.\\nAUTOMATED SPEECH RECOGNITION  1992\\nIn 1992, Jay Wilpon (SVP of Natural Language Research at \\nInteractions) and a team of researchers at AT&T deployed the first \\nnationwide automated speech recognition (ASR) using a machine \\nlearning approach called Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).

We show how the algorithms we described are motivated \\nby the need to solve very simple automation tasks, such as the \\nrecognition of spoken words or written digits, and how AT&T \\nshowed a strong leadership in this process.\\nTHE TURING TEST  1950\\nIn 1950, Alan Turing created the “Turing Test” to determine \\nwhether or not a computer was capable of real intelligence. In \\norder to pass the test, the computer had to be able to fool another \\nhuman into believing it was also human.\\nTHE FIRST COMPUTER PROGRAM  1952\\nArthur Samuel created the first implementation of machine \\nlearning, the game of checkers, in 1952. The computer improved \\nat the game the more it played by determining which moves \\nresulted in winning strategies, and incorporating those strategies \\ninto the game.\\nNEURAL NETWORKS FOR COMPUTERS  1957\\nFrank Rosenblatt designed the first neural network for computers \\nin 1957, which was meant to simulate the thought process of a \\nhuman brain.\\n“NEAREST NEIGHBOR” ALGORITHM  1967\\nThe “nearest neighbor” algorithm was written in 1967, allowing \\ncomputers to begin recognizing basic patterns. This could be used \\nas a mapping route for traveling salesmen.EXPLANATION BASED LEARNING  1981\\nEBL, or Explanation Based Learning, was created in 1981 by \\nGerald Dejong. This concept allowed a computer to analyze \\ntraining data and create a general rule it can follow by discarding \\nunimportant data.\\nMACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH GROUP  1985\\nResearchers from AT&T created the first research group for \\nmachine learning in 1985. They also began a series of machine \\nlearning meetings that eventually turned into NIPS, the leading \\nconference on machine learning. This group was representative \\nof the early machine learning community, breaking away from a \\ncomputer science field still mostly interested in expert systems. \\nThese theoreticians were confronted with real world problems \\nwhere machines had to replace humans in recognizing noisy \\nwritten digits: mainly check amounts and zip codes.\\nAUTOMATED SPEECH RECOGNITION  1992\\nIn 1992, Jay Wilpon (SVP of Natural Language Research at \\nInteractions) and a team of researchers at AT&T deployed the first \\nnationwide automated speech recognition (ASR) using a machine \\nlearning approach called Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). This \\nsaved billions of dollars in operating costs by spotting things like \\ncollect calls.\\nSUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES  1992\\nResearchers at AT&T invented Support Vector Machines (SVMs) \\nin 1992, a technique that revolutionized large scale classification \\nbecause of its predictable performance.\\n5\\n', 'question': {'question': 'What is meant by computational finance?'}}\n"
